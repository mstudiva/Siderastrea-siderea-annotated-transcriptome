Ssiderea030135	coreceptor activity involved in Wnt signaling pathway, planar cell polarity pathway
Ssiderea034309	Receptor tyrosine kinase which mediates the pleiotropic actions of insulin. Binding of insulin leads to phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates, including, insulin receptor substrates (IRS1, 2, 3, 4), SHC, GAB1, CBL and other signaling intermediates. Each of these phosphorylated proteins serve as docking proteins for other signaling proteins that contain Src- homology-2 domains (SH2 domain) that specifically recognize different phosphotyrosine residues, including the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K and SHP2. Phosphorylation of IRSs proteins lead to the activation of two main signaling pathways the PI3K-AKT PKB pathway, which is responsible for most of the metabolic actions of insulin, and the Ras-MAPK pathway, which regulates expression of some genes and cooperates with the PI3K pathway to control cell growth and differentiation. Binding of the SH2 domains of PI3K to phosphotyrosines on IRS1 leads to the activation of PI3K and the generation of phosphatidylinositol-(3, 4, 5)-triphosphate (PIP3), a lipid second messenger, which activates several PIP3-dependent serine threonine kinases, such as PDPK1 and subsequently AKT PKB. The net effect of this pathway is to produce a translocation of the glucose transporter SLC2A4 GLUT4 from cytoplasmic vesicles to the cell membrane to facilitate glucose transport. Moreover, upon insulin stimulation, activated AKT PKB is responsible for anti- apoptotic effect of insulin by inducing phosphorylation of BAD

Efficiently unwinds G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structures and forked RNA-DNA hybrids. Resolves G4 structures, preventing replication pausing and double-strand breaks (DSBs) at G4 motifs. Involved in the maintenance of telomeric DNA. Inhibits telomere elongation, de novo telomere formation and telomere addition to DSBs via catalytic inhibition of telomerase. Reduces the processivity of telomerase by displacing active telomerase from DNA ends. Releases telomerase by unwinding the short telomerase RNA telomeric DNA hybrid that is the intermediate in the telomerase reaction. Involved in the maintenance of ribosomal (rDNA). Required for efficient fork arrest at the replicaion fork barrier within rDNA. Involved in the maintenance of mitochondrial (mtDNA). Required to maintain mtDNA under conditions that introduce dsDNA breaks in mtDNA, either preventing or repairing dsDNA breaks. May inhibit replication progression to allow time for repair. May have a general role in chromosomal replication by affecting Okazaki fragment maturation. May have a role in conjunction with DNA2 helicase nuclease in 5'-flap extension during Okazaki fragment processing

Cleaves the beta-aspartyl- glucosamine (GlcNAc) of the glycan and the amide side chain of Asn, converting Asn to Asp. Prefers proteins containing high- mannose over those bearing complex type oligosaccharides. Can recognize misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum that are exported to the cytosol to be destroyed and deglycosylate them, while it has no activity toward native proteins. Deglycosylation is a prerequisite for subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation of some, but not all, misfolded glycoproteins

Ssiderea035930	Required for RNA-mediated gene silencing (RNAi) by the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The 'minimal RISC' appears to include ago2 bound to a short guide RNA such as a microRNA (miRNA) or short interfering RNA (siRNA). These guide RNAs direct RISC to complementary mRNAs that are targets for RISC-mediated gene silencing. The precise mechanism of gene silencing depends on the degree of complementarity between the miRNA or siRNA and its target. Binding of RISC to a perfectly complementary mRNA generally results in silencing due to endonucleolytic cleavage of the mRNA specifically by ago2. Binding of RISC to a partially complementary mRNA results in silencing through inhibition of translation, and this is independent of endonuclease activity. The inhibition of translational initiation leads to the accumulation of the affected mRNA in cytoplasmic processing bodies (P-bodies), where mRNA degradation may subsequently occur

Ssiderea035934	Required for RNA-mediated gene silencing (RNAi) by the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The 'minimal RISC' appears to include AGO2 bound to a short guide RNA such as a microRNA (miRNA) or short interfering RNA (siRNA). These guide RNAs direct RISC to complementary mRNAs that are targets for RISC-mediated gene silencing. The precise mechanism of gene silencing depends on the degree of complementarity between the miRNA or siRNA and its target. Binding of RISC to a perfectly complementary mRNA generally results in silencing due to endonucleolytic cleavage of the mRNA specifically by AGO2. Binding of RISC to a partially complementary mRNA results in silencing through inhibition of translation, and this is independent of endonuclease activity. May inhibit translation initiation by binding to the 7-methylguanosine cap, thereby preventing the recruitment of the translation initiation factor eIF4-E. May also inhibit translation initiation via interaction with EIF6, which itself binds to the 60S ribosomal subunit and prevents its association with the 40S ribosomal subunit. The inhibition of translational initiation leads to the accumulation of the affected mRNA in cytoplasmic processing bodies (P-bodies), where mRNA degradation may subsequently occur. In some cases RISC-mediated translational repression is also observed for miRNAs that perfectly match the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR). Can also up-regulate the translation of specific mRNAs under certain growth conditions. Binds to the AU element of the 3'-UTR of the TNF (TNF-alpha) mRNA and up-regulates translation under conditions of serum starvation. Also required for transcriptional gene silencing (TGS), in which short RNAs known as antigene RNAs or agRNAs direct the transcriptional repression of complementary promoter regions

Ssiderea041764	Centrosomal protein
Ssiderea033585	A helicase nuclease that prepares dsDNA breaks (DSB) for recombinational DNA repair. Binds to DSBs and unwinds DNA via a highly rapid and processive ATP-dependent bidirectional helicase activity. Unwinds dsDNA until it encounters a Chi (crossover hotspot instigator) sequence from the 3' direction. Cuts ssDNA a few nucleotides 3' to the Chi site. The properties and activities of the enzyme are changed at Chi. The Chi-altered holoenzyme produces a long 3'-ssDNA overhang and facilitates RecA-binding to the ssDNA for homologous DNA recombination and repair. Holoenzyme degrades any linearized DNA that is unable to undergo homologous recombination. In the holoenzyme this subunit has ssDNA-dependent ATPase and 5'-3' helicase activity. When added to pre-assembled RecBC greatly stimulates nuclease activity and augments holoenzyme processivity. Negatively regulates the RecA-loading ability of RecBCD

Ssiderea054444	Voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) mediate the entry of calcium ions into excitable cells and are also involved in a variety of calcium-dependent processes, including muscle contraction, hormone or neurotransmitter release, gene expression, cell motility, cell division and cell death. The isoform alpha-1C gives rise to L-type calcium currents. Long-lasting (L-type) calcium channels belong to the 'high-voltage activated' (HVA) group. They are blocked by dihydropyridines (DHP), phenylalkylamines, benzothiazepines, and by omega-agatoxin-IIIA (omega-Aga-IIIA). They are however insensitive to omega-conotoxin- GVIA (omega-CTx-GVIA) and omega-agatoxin-IVA (omega-Aga-IVA). Calcium channels containing the alpha-1C subunit play an important role in excitation-contraction coupling in the heart. Binding of calmodulin or CABP1 at the same regulatory sites results in an opposit effects on the channel function

Ssiderea042697	The SMN complex plays a catalyst role in the assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), the building blocks of the spliceosome. Thereby, plays an important role in the splicing of cellular pre-mRNAs. Most spliceosomal snRNPs contain a common set of Sm proteins SNRPB, SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPD3, SNRPE, SNRPF and SNRPG that assemble in a heptameric protein ring on the Sm site of the small nuclear RNA to form the core snRNP. In the cytosol, the Sm proteins SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPE, SNRPF and SNRPG are trapped in an inactive 6S pICln-Sm complex by the chaperone CLNS1A that controls the assembly of the core snRNP. Dissociation by the SMN complex of CLNS1A from the trapped Sm proteins and their transfer to an SMN-Sm complex triggers the assembly of core snRNPs and their transport to the nucleus. Ensures the correct splicing of U12 intron-containing genes that may be important for normal motor and proprioceptive neurons development. Also required for resolving RNA-DNA hybrids created by RNA polymerase II, that form R-loop in transcription terminal regions, an important step in proper transcription termination. May also play a role in the metabolism of small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNPs)

Ssiderea035933	Required for RNA-mediated gene silencing (RNAi) by the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The 'minimal RISC' appears to include AGO2 bound to a short guide RNA such as a microRNA (miRNA) or short interfering RNA (siRNA). These guide RNAs direct RISC to complementary mRNAs that are targets for RISC-mediated gene silencing. The precise mechanism of gene silencing depends on the degree of complementarity between the miRNA or siRNA and its target. Binding of RISC to a perfectly complementary mRNA generally results in silencing due to endonucleolytic cleavage of the mRNA specifically by AGO2. Binding of RISC to a partially complementary mRNA results in silencing through inhibition of translation, and this is independent of endonuclease activity. May inhibit translation initiation by binding to the 7-methylguanosine cap, thereby preventing the recruitment of the translation initiation factor eIF4-E. May also inhibit translation initiation via interaction with EIF6, which itself binds to the 60S ribosomal subunit and prevents its association with the 40S ribosomal subunit. The inhibition of translational initiation leads to the accumulation of the affected mRNA in cytoplasmic processing bodies (P-bodies), where mRNA degradation may subsequently occur. In some cases RISC-mediated translational repression is also observed for miRNAs that perfectly match the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR). Can also up-regulate the translation of specific mRNAs under certain growth conditions. Binds to the AU element of the 3'-UTR of the TNF (TNF-alpha) mRNA and up-regulates translation under conditions of serum starvation. Also required for transcriptional gene silencing (TGS), in which short RNAs known as antigene RNAs or agRNAs direct the transcriptional repression of complementary promoter regions

Involved in the maintenance of telomeric DNA. Inhibits telomere elongation, de novo telomere formation and telomere addition to DSBs via catalytic inhibition of telomerase. Reduces the processivity of telomerase by displacing active telomerase from DNA ends. Releases telomerase by unwinding the short telomerase RNA telomeric DNA hybrid that is the intermediate in the telomerase reaction. Involved in the maintenance of ribosomal (rDNA). Required for efficient fork arrest at the replicaion fork barrier within rDNA. Involved in the maintenance of mitochondrial (mtDNA). Required to maintain mtDNA under conditions that introduce dsDNA breaks in mtDNA, either preventing or repairing dsDNA breaks. May inhibit replication progression to allow time for repair. May have a general role in chromosomal replication by affecting Okazaki fragment maturation. May have a role in conjunction with DNA2 helicase nuclease in 5'-flap extension during Okazaki fragment processing

Ssiderea053647	solute carrier family 35, member D3
Ssiderea050642	Cotransporter which plays a role in lipoprotein, vitamin and iron metabolism, by facilitating their uptake. Binds to ALB, MB, Kappa and lambda-light chains, TF, hemoglobin, GC, SCGB1A1, APOA1, high density lipoprotein, and the GIF-cobalamin complex. The binding of all ligands requires calcium. Serves as important transporter in several absorptive epithelia, including intestine, renal proximal tubules and embryonic yolk sac. Interaction with LRP2 mediates its trafficking throughout vesicles and facilitates the uptake of specific ligands like GC, hemoglobin, ALB, TF and SCGB1A1. Interaction with AMN controls its trafficking to the plasma membrane and facilitates endocytosis of ligands. May play an important role in the development of the peri-implantation embryo through internalization of APOA1 and cholesterol. Binds to LGALS3 at the maternal-fetal interface

Ssiderea020293	Regulatory subunit of the poly(A)-nuclease (PAN) deadenylation complex, one of two cytoplasmic mRNA deadenylases involved in general and miRNA-mediated mRNA turnover. PAN specifically shortens poly(A) tails of RNA and the activity is stimulated by poly(A)-binding protein (PABP). PAN deadenylation is followed by rapid degradation of the shortened mRNA tails by the CCR4-NOT complex. Deadenylated mRNAs are then degraded by two alternative mechanisms, namely exosome-mediated 3'-5' exonucleolytic degradation, or deadenlyation-dependent mRNA decaping and subsequent 5'-3' exonucleolytic degradation by XRN1. PAN3 acts as a positive regulator for PAN activity, recruiting the catalytic subunit PAN2 to mRNA via its interaction with RNA and PABP, and to miRNA targets via its interaction with GW182 family proteins

Ssiderea054443	Voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) mediate the entry of calcium ions into excitable cells and are also involved in a variety of calcium-dependent processes, including muscle contraction, hormone or neurotransmitter release, gene expression, cell motility, cell division and cell death. The isoform alpha-1C gives rise to L-type calcium currents. Long-lasting (L-type) calcium channels belong to the 'high-voltage activated' (HVA) group. They are blocked by dihydropyridines (DHP), phenylalkylamines, benzothiazepines, and by omega-agatoxin-IIIA (omega-Aga-IIIA). They are however insensitive to omega-conotoxin- GVIA (omega-CTx-GVIA) and omega-agatoxin-IVA (omega-Aga-IVA). Calcium channels containing the alpha-1C subunit play an important role in excitation-contraction coupling in the heart. Binding of calmodulin or CABP1 at the same regulatory sites results in an opposit effects on the channel function

Ssiderea049211	Involved in intracellular signal transduction mediated by cytokines and growth factors. When associated with STAM, it suppresses DNA signaling upon stimulation by IL-2 and GM-CSF. Could be a direct effector of PI3-kinase in vesicular pathway via early endosomes and may regulate trafficking to early and late endosomes by recruiting clathrin. May concentrate ubiquitinated receptors within clathrin-coated regions. Involved in down- regulation of receptor tyrosine kinase via multivesicular body (MVBs) when complexed with STAM (ESCRT-0 complex). The ESCRT-0 complex binds ubiquitin and acts as sorting machinery that recognizes ubiquitinated receptors and transfers them to further sequential lysosomal sorting trafficking processes. May contribute to the efficient recruitment of SMADs to the activin receptor complex. Involved in receptor recycling via its association with the CART complex, a multiprotein complex required for efficient transferrin receptor recycling but not for EGFR degradation

Recognizes and selectively binds the transmembrane domain of TA proteins in the cytosol. This complex then targets to the endoplasmic reticulum by membrane-bound receptors, where the tail- anchored protein is released for insertion. This process is regulated by ATP binding and hydrolysis. ATP binding drives the homodimer towards the closed dimer state, facilitating recognition of newly synthesized TA membrane proteins. ATP hydrolysis is required for insertion. Subsequently, the homodimer reverts towards the open dimer state, lowering its affinity for the membrane-bound receptor, and returning it to the cytosol to initiate a new round of targeting

Ssiderea054062	this phosphorylation event is a prerequisite for the subsequent ligation of the two exon halves and the production of a mature tRNA. Component of the pre-mRNA cleavage complex II (CF-II), which seems to be required for mRNA 3'-end formation. Also phosphorylates the 5'-terminus of exogenously introduced short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which is a necessary prerequisite for their incorporation into the RNA- induced silencing complex (RISC). However, endogenous siRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs) that are produced by the cleavage of dsRNA precursors by DICER1 already contain a 5'-phosphate group, so this protein may be dispensible for normal RNA-mediated gene silencing

Component of the pre-mRNA cleavage complex II (CF-II), which seems to be required for mRNA 3'-end formation. Also phosphorylates the 5'-terminus of exogenously introduced short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which is a necessary prerequisite for their incorporation into the RNA- induced silencing complex (RISC). However, endogenous siRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs) that are produced by the cleavage of dsRNA precursors by DICER1 already contain a 5'-phosphate group, so this protein may be dispensible for normal RNA-mediated gene silencing
